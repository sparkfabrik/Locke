Describe here all useful information about deploying on sensitive environments, from CI to production.

If deploy to production is done by the customer or 3rd party and we don't have the permission to touch the server, please:

* Note it anyway
* Write and link the [Release package creation guide](/tech-guides/how-to-create-release-packages) so that everybody can produce a deploy package.
